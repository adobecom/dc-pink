## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [Adobe Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Jira Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
**Important:** When working on a Jira issue, you must create and checkout a branch named after the Jira issue.

#### Format
- **Format:** `MWPW-{issue-number}
- **Example:** `MWPW-12345`
- **Example:** `MWPW-67890`

#### Steps
1. **Before starting work on any Jira issue:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b MWPW-12345
   ```

2. **Make your changes on the feature branch**

3. **Push your branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin MWPW-12345
   ```

4. **Create a pull request from your branch to `main`**

### Jira Issue Linking
- Always link your pull request to the corresponding Jira issue
- Use the format: `Resolves: [MWPW-XXXXXX](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/MWPW-XXXXXX)`
- Update the Jira issue status as you progress through development

## Development Workflow

### Setup
1. Install the [AEM CLI](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli): `sudo npm install -g @adobe/aem-cli`
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder
3. Run `aem up` to start the development server (opens browser at `http://localhost:3000`)
4. Start coding in your favorite editor

### Branch Management
- `main` branch is the stable branch
- All development work should be done on feature branches
- Feature branches should be created from the latest `main`
- Branch names must follow the Jira naming convention (see above)

### Commit Messages
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Reference the Jira issue in your commits: `MWPW-12345: Fix accessibility issues in prompt card`
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/ES6+
- Follow the existing ESLint configuration (`.eslintrc.js`)
- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use template literals for string interpolation

- Use meaningful class names
- Follow BEM methodology where applicable

### Accessibility

- Provide appropriate ARIA labels and roles
- Test with screen readers when possible
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines

### File Organization
- Keep files small and focused
- Use descriptive file and folder names
- Follow the existing project structure

## Testing

npm run test

# Run Web Test Runner unit tests
npm run wtr
